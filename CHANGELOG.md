## [Unreleased]

## [v0.4.0] - 2020-09-11

- Regenerate crate with msp430_svd v0.4.0 and svd2rust commit 481f6b8
  (v0.25.1 plus `critical_section` functionality, and some documentation
  fixes). _msp430_svd changes are [bug fixes](https://github.com/pftbest/msp430_svd/issues/18#issuecomment-1234972220)
  to the provided SVD._

- Update msp430 and msp430-rt to version 0.4.0.

Breaking changes include:

- Data types in API generated by svd2rust have changed, e.g. they now use
  `const` generics. However, type inference means that source changes to
  applications upgrading from [v0.3.0] to [v0.4.0] are minimal.
- Add `critical_section` optional dependency/feature which enables the
  `Peripherals::take` method. An external crate such as msp430 is expected
  to provide an implementation of the `extern` functions in [critical_section](https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section).
  Previously, a hardcoded `Peripherals::take` implementation was always
  provided without a feature.

## [v0.3.0] - 2022-01-25
This crate was regenerated three times to take advantage of svd2rust commit 26baf2c,
svd2rust 0.18.0, and then svd2rust 0.20.0. Non-breaking changes include:

- The newer versions of msp430_svd did not cause significant changes to this
  crate (some fields of the SVD were moved around).

Breaking changes include:

- New versions of svd2rust caused backwards-incompatible changes.
  See commits 287e48a, 68e45a9. 0.20.0 breakage is likely minimal.
- Update msp430 and msp430-rt to version 0.3.0 and bare-metal to 1.0.0.

## [v0.2.1] - 2021-04-16
- Put msp430_svd version information into the SVD file using
  `vendorExtensions`.

- Leverage the work of `svdtools` to fill in missing register fields.
  These _appear_ to all be backward-compatible changes.

## [v0.2.0] - 2020-01-15
- Regenerate crate with svd2rust v0.17.0 plus msp-fix commits.
  - Remove empty enumerations which violate SVD spec.

- Update msp430 and msp430-rt to version 0.2.0.

## [v0.1.4] - 2018-06-18
- Updated msp430-rt to version 0.1.3.

## [v0.1.3] - 2018-06-18
Version `v0.1.2` was never released due to an oversight.

- Updated msp430-rt to version 0.1.2.

- Fix for macro_reexport feature.

## [v0.1.1] - 2018-02-02
- Updated msp430-rt to version 0.1.1.

## v0.1.0 - 2017-07-24
